Subject: [PATCH 030/103] arm64/perf: fix backtrace for AAPCS with FP enabled

This change is for arm64 platform compat mode.
The change for arm32 platform has been included in this commit "perf: fix
backtrace for AAPCS with FP enabled".

This change replaces code designed for the obsolete ARM APCS ABI, which
causes failures of the perf backtrace logic unless the gcc option
-mapcs-frame is used to build all binaries on the platform.  This
obsolete gcc option forces the compiler to include the stack pointer
along with the frame pointer and link register in the stack frame
for each funciton call. The current AAPCS ABI document, doesn't
explicitly describe the frame structure when the gcc frame pointer
option, -fno-omit-frame-pointer, is enabled. However, with this option
enabled, examination of the emitted prologue instructions shows that
1) R11 is used as the frame pointer,
2) only the R11 and LR are saved onto the stack, not the stack pointer,
3) after this prologue setup, the frame pointer, R11 points to the
saved location of LR on the stack.

The use of unsigned int arithmetic in the commit is required since
the gcc emitted pointer arithmetic uses 8-byte pointer sizes, which are
incorrect addresses for the 4-byte stack address size.
